## KPI Analysis for Sales and Marketing (KPI.ipynb)

# Overview
This project focuses on KPI (Key Performance Indicator) analysis for a sales dataset, combining marketing costs and sales performance to derive key insights. It includes visualizations and ROI (Return on Investment) calculations to assess the performance of different marketing strategies over time.

# Key Features
Data Extraction and Processing:
Sales and marketing datasets are imported using pandas from Excel files.
The project integrates multiple sheets (Sales Data and Marketing Costs) and performs data wrangling to clean and merge the information.

Data Visualization:
seaborn and matplotlib libraries are used to create plots and visualizations that provide insights into sales performance by year, category, and return on marketing spend.
Key visualizations include:
Yearly total sales.
Yearly total sales by category.
Return on marketing spend.
Average Order Value by Category.

KPI Calculations:
The project calculates and visualizes critical metrics such as:
Yearly sales by category.
Return on Investment (ROI) by comparing sales and marketing costs.
Average Order Value (AOV) to determine the spending behavior of different customer segments.

Automated Reporting:
Results, including visualizations and tabular data, are saved as an HTML report, making it easy to share insights with stakeholders.
The report automatically compiles key figures, trends, and visualizations, allowing for quick review and decision-making.

Libraries Used:
pandas: For data import, manipulation, and merging of datasets.
seaborn and matplotlib: For visualizing trends and insights from the data.
IPython: To display HTML reports and plots within the notebook environment.
