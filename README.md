# Project Summary:
This project combines web scraping and KPI analysis to automate data collection and generate business insights. The web scraping tool extracts product details (names, prices, links) from Amazon, enabling efficient data gathering for e-commerce analysis.

The KPI analysis component evaluates sales and marketing performance, calculating key metrics such as sales, ROI, and Average Order Value (AOV). It visualizes these insights, helping businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve financial outcomes.

Together, the project provides a streamlined solution for data extraction and performance analysis, supporting data-driven decision-making.
